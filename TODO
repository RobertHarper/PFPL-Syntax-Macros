Extend judgments with formal and exact equality.  The former are defined by rules using \equiv{} notation; the latter are defined by induction on type using \doteq{} notation.  Presuppositional vs assuring formulations of formal equality?
Cotermination and Kleene equivalence are defined for states in terms of final states; in "pure" cases the states are closed expressions or computations, but in "impure" cases other structure is required.  Extend at least to observational equivalence defined as the coarsest consistent congruence on forms of expression, the idea being that complete programs of answer type determine initial states, and final answers may be extracted from final states, being either yes or no (no reliance on locations, etc).
Phases influence both formal and semantic equality, as "possible worlds" with anti-monotonicity relative to entailment.  Phase-separated languages do not need phases; phase-integrated languages may admit phase separation (?).
